_Assist Chess_ is intended for beginner to intermediate players to help them make the best move.
Too often have I lost a lost a chess piece or made a dumb move because I couldn't see that it was being attacked.
With this, players have to worry less about checking every piece and more on the strategy.
The objective of _Assist Chess_ is to provide enough useful information to inform the player, but not too much as to choose a move for you or be overwhelming.

### Options:
- **Show defended pieces** indicates with a shield icon pieces that are being defended by another piece of the same color
- **Show pinned pieces** indicates pieces that are trapped behind another piece that is being attached, hence "pinned"
- **Show pieces in danger** outlines in red pieces that could be taken by your opponent
- **Show captures** outlines in green pieces that you could capture from your opponent
- **Show all moves** shades the cell of squares you could move to with any piece
- **Show current move** shades the cells that the piece you are currently dragging can move to
